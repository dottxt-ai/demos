╭─────────── Neon Blades: A Cyberpunk Showdown ────────────╮
│ In a neon-drenched future, mega-corporations hold the    │
│ power. The streets are filled with augmented humans,     │
│ cybernetic implants, and advanced technology. The rich   │
│ live in luxurious sky-scrapers while the poor fight for  │
│ survival in the gritty, crime-ridden lower levels. The   │
│ line between human and machine has been blurred, and the │
│ world is on the brink of a new revolution as factions    │
│ fight for control of the city's dwindling resources and  │
│ its inhabitants' minds and bodies. The city's leader, a  │
│ powerful AI, maintains control through its vast network  │
│ of surveillance and cybernetic enforcers. The conflict   │
│ between the haves and have-nots is reaching a boiling    │
│ point, and the streets are no longer safe for the        │
│ innocent or the guilty alike. In this world, the only    │

│ the city to stay one step ahead of the inevitable hunt   │
│ that will be relentlessly pursued by those seeking       │
│ vengeance for the stolen secrets and retribution for the │
│ ruthlessly vanquished. Zara's death serves as both a     │
│ turning point and a warning to the unsavory elements     │
│ that Axel will stop at nothing to accomplish his goals,  │
│ leaving a chilling legacy of the price for crossing him  │
│ amidst the neon-drenched, rain-soaked alleys of the      │
