        1. Look ONLY at the "Consolidated Statements of Income" table

        3. For net income, use the TOTAL net income figure, not amounts allocated to specific share classes

        - Revenue: Total sales of goods and services. Usually this is at the top of the
        income statement.

        minus costs. Operating income is also called operating profit, EBIT, or income from
